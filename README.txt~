Structure is as follows:
- AbstractSyntax : Base module, doesn't import anything from the
hierarchy.
- CompExp : Only uses AbstractSyntax.
- DenSemantics : Uses AbstractSyntax and CompExp for both the Stack
Machine definition and the syntax.
- Proofs : Uses AbstractSyntax, CompExp, and DenSemantics. Puts
everything together to form proofs for the stack machine's compiler.
