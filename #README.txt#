We have structured our solution into multiple files. The structure is as follows:
- AbstractSyntax : Contains the syntax for the operations of the stack machine.
- CompExp : Contains the compiler and stack-machine.
- DenSemantics :Contains the denotational semantics for the instructions of the language.
- Proofs : Contains the proofs of soundness and adequacy
-Main :
